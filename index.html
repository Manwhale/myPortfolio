						<p>Interests that drive me:</p>
						<ul> <!--this code below lists sentences in bullet points within ex: "<li>here</li>"" -->
							<li>Cars are my life I currently own a Nissan 350z 2008 that has been my dream car ever since Tokyo Drift was released in 2006.</li>
							<li>Video games are a part of me, my first console was a Nintendo 64 and I have never let it go. I want to give back to the 
								gaming community and be a part of a large team that creates the visual aspects of a game.</li>
