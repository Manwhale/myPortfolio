                <p>Hi üÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏è!</p>
                <p>I'm a student at <a href="https://thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> living in San Diego, California.</p>
                <p>Interests that drive me:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cars are my life! I currently own a Nissan 350z 2008‚Äîmy dream car ever since *Tokyo Drift* was released in 2006.</li>
                    <li>Video games are a part of me. My first console was a Nintendo 64, and I've never let go. My goal is to contribute to the gaming industry by working on game visuals.</li>
                    <li>My dog's happiness! If they are happy, I'm happy.</li>
                </ul>
